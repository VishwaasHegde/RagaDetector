# Raga Detection Using Machine Learning
This repository contains code for an end to end model for raga and tonic identification on audio samples

Note: This repository currently only contains inference code, the training code and lots of experimental code can be accessed here: https://github.com/VishwaasHegde/E2ERaga
However it is not well maintained.

### A paper on this has been published: https://aimc2023.pubpub.org/pub/j9v30p0j/release/1

# Getting Started
Requires `python==3.7.16`

Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) for easier package management

Install the requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Model
1. Create an empty folder called `model` and place it in SPD_KNN folder
2. Download the pitch model from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1On0sbDARW6uVvfVQ6IJkhWtUaaH1fBw8/view?usp=sharing) and place it in the 'model' folder
3.  Download the tonic models (Hindustani and Carnatic) from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h7dois2zZMLBcx7gl-_0phlILzOUvL8q?usp=sharing) and place it in the 'model' folder
4. Download the Carnatic raga models from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OXGknLkShVFQSCZkcIfdIl5eYeCN9T9E?usp=sharing) and place it in 'data\RagaDataset\Carnatic\model' (create empty folders if you need)
5. Download the Hindustani raga models from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14OMUyhbA2sw2rD6y1-cMINreo-S-GaiE?usp=sharing) and place it in 'data\RagaDataset\Hindustani\model' (create empty folders if you need)
 

## Data
1. I dont have the permisssion to upload the datasets, the datasets has to be obtained by request from here: https://compmusic.upf.edu/node/328

## Run Time Input
E2ERaga supports audio samples which can be recorded at runtime

Steps to run:
1. Run the command `python main.py --runtime=True --tradition=h --duration=30` 
2. You can change the tradition (hindustani or carnatic) by choosing h/c and duration to record in seconds
3. Once you run this command, there will be a prompt - `Press 1 to start recording or press 0 to exit:`
4. Enter accordingly and start recording for `duration` duration
5. After this the raga label and the tonic is outputted
6. The tonic can also be optionally given by `--tonic=D` for specify `D` pitch as the tonic.

## File input
E2ERaga supports recorded audio samples which can be provided at runtime

Steps to run:
1. Run the command `python main.py --runtime_file=<audio_file_path> --tradition=<h/c>`
   
   Example: `python main.py --runtime_file=data/sample_data/Jog_0.wav --tradition=h`
3. The model supports wav and mp3 file, with mp3 there will be a delay in converting into wav format internally
4. After this the raga label and the tonic frequency is outputted

Acknowledgments:
1. The model uses [CREPE](https://github.com/marl/crepe) to find the pitches for the audio, I would like to thank [Jong Wook](https://github.com/jongwook) for clarifiying my questions
2. Also thank [CompMusic](https://compmusic.upf.edu/node/328) and Sankalp Gulati for providing me the datasets
